26081,light gray ::  dark colors makes things really hot for examp le the black reached up to 54* C white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43* C the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46* C at most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold.,2,2
26023,"white :: The white paint should keep the inside temper ature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day, than say black paint for examp le. When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the whi te lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature. On average about 6.6(DEG) C cooler, compared with the averages for the other lids. So, therefore white pa int is the better choice, especially if you are looking to keep the insid e of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day.",2,2
26258,white :: The white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors. The white Low data for white was 41(DEG) and the hig h data was 43(DEG).,2,2
27375,dark gray ::  I would say dark gray because when the sun co mes out you don't want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gra y would work perfectly in my opinion.,1,1
26703,"black :: If they choose to paint the dog house black, it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy. In the investigation, th e average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG)C versus the white wh ich had an average of 42(DEG)C. Therefore, if Brandi and Jerry paint t he dog house black, it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors .",2,2
27474,white :: The doghouse will usually be cool inside even on sunny days because the light from the sun will reflect off of the dog house causing the light to not enter it and make the transformation into thermal ( heat ) energy.,1,2
27570,"black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.",2,2
26074,"black :: Having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors.",2,2
26105,"white :: White. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18(DEG) C. In the experiment, the starting temperature of was 24(DEG) C and after ten minutes under a lamp, the air inside the jar increased by 18(DEG) C. To tal of 42(DEG) C. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high.",2,2
26231,"black :: The color black would effect the inside of th e doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat, keeping the dog warm. As in the experiment, while the black lid was over the thermometer and th e light was 5 centimeters away, the temperature on the thermometer increa sed by 29(DEG) C.",1,1
26605,black ::  It will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable.,1,1
26581,"light gray ::  They don't want it to be too cold, but not to o hot either. A light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog, but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11(DEG)C. That isn't too much, so the dog won't suffocate, but it won't freeze to death either.",1,1
26018,light gray :: Light gray will be that color because you cou ld actually what color you are doing like when you paint that house and m aybe in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the house bla ck.,1,1
27435,"black :: We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat. Knowing this information, for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse, Brandi and Jerry should paint the house Black.",2,2
26040,white :: The color black tends to make things hotter a nd so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. For the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased( t emp:54) and for the white it decresed(temp:42). This is because the energ y is sucked out from the dark colors. Also dogs have alot of fur so it wo uld be best to have a cooler house.,1,1
26303,white :: If you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun. In the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG) but it was 53(DEG) for the black lid. You pr obably don't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white.,2,2
26577,white :: it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er,1,1
27309,white ::  i think that if you use a white paint then th e dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would ge t hot so that why you shuld use white.,1,1
26799,"white :: by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42(DEG)c , and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53(DEG)c. by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11(DEG)c t han painting the doghouse black. therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature.",2,2
27211,white :: the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool.,1,1
27440,"white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray, light gray and black. also, because blacks average (in (DEG)c) was 53 dark grays average was 48. li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler.",2,2
27162,dark gray :: dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog,1,1
26394,light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold. at black the temperatu re was 53(DEG)c and at white the temperature was 42(DEG)c. but at light gray it was 45(DEG)c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold.,2,2
26721,black :: Black would be a good because it is a dark co lor and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog.,1,1
27389,white :: I choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more c ooler. I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42(DEG) C which is the lowest while the black had 54(DEG)C which is the highest.,2,2
26841,white ::  because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse,0,0
26027,"white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler. In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as.",2,2
27362,"light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.",2,2
26243,white :: If Brandi and Jerry dont want the dog to get to hot then they would want to pick white because it does not increase th e air temperature as much as black,1,1
26611,"black :: If the doghouse is black, it will absorb more energy then the other colors. This is apparent in the test, where the st arting temperature for the glass jar was 24(DEG) C, and the black jar we nt up to 53(DEG) C, while the white jar only went up to 42(DEG) C.",1,1
