Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.

24138,the author starts back in the day when space came to the attentions of the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. and how over the years things have progressed and how we have left jusk in outer space that could mean a threat to us at some point.,1,0
24147,"The author starts with 'Orbiting Junk' and 'What Is Space Junk' to describe exactly what space junk is and what it is caused by. The author then follows with 'Crash Course' and uses this section to explain what the problems are that space junk can cause. Finally, the author ends with 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' and describes what can be done to prevent the problems that space junk causes and what space centers are doing to help the cause.",2,1
24148,"The author organizes the article into multiple sections divided by headings.  The author does this to help the reader get a better understanding about what he/she is learning about.  First, you learn about the history of space travel.  Then, you are given information on a real collision that occured a couple of years ago.  Following this, the information is then put into perspective by talking about a sandblaster.  Finally, the call to action takes place to conclude this article.",2,1
24149,"The author organizes the article by first explaining the origins of the microdebris that litters the solar system, then going into explaining the harmful problem that this debris is creating for the Earth's surface.",2,1
24152,"The author organized this article very well.  After introducing the piece, he went straight to informing/educating his readers about how space junk came to exist.  He then moves on to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk, followed by the importance of awarness and concerns of space junk.  He informs his readers how the various pieces of junk can be harmful to machinery that scientists send into space, but alo how the damage from the collisions of space junk to said machines is unavoidable.  The author then ties up the peice with how space agencies are hoping to work with other coroporations and even nations to come up with a solution to the 'space pollution'.",2,1
24158,The author describes how space junk is prodused and what causes it to become small bits of space junk. The artical starts with satellites and works his way down to what microdebris is made of.,1,0
24163,The author organizes this article from begining to end. The author starts with simple factas and attention getters then makes the way down towards the imoportant facts. The author has three major facts and he supports them with detail and then give their overall veiw of their oppion on the article.,2,1
24165,The author organizes this article by having headings.  The heading 'What Is Space Junk' lets you know this passage will be about space junk and what it is.  Each heading helps the reader know exactly what they will be reading about. This is a good way of keeping an article organized.,2,1
24180,"The author organize the article by what is space junk, In 1957, the soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite. The next section is about crash course, with no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other. The last section is about little bits, but a big deal, Actually, many people do. Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.",2,1

When you read the article it is easier for someone to remember where or what they were reading about.,1,0
24215,"The author organizes the article in a way that allows the reader to understand what is happening. Most readers do not know what 'space junk' is, and the author uses their organization skills to tell the readers how the junk came to be and how dangerous 'space junk' can be.",0,1
24226,"The author organizes the article by putting it in sections , each title foreshadows what the section will most likely be about. In the lines ' Orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions ' , is under the title Orbiting Junk , which fits the title perfectly.",2,1
24227,"The author begins with an attention-grabbing introduction. Next they explain what caused the 'space junk' to accumulate. Then the author warns us of what may happen if we continue to pollute space. Finally, the author states facts that support their statement.",2,1
24233,"He first starts with an attention getter. Then he explains to the reader what space junk is, when is started and how. He uses an example of space junk by talking about serious collisons with unsed satellites. He then describes how fast things are really going in space by using sand as an example.",1,2
24241,"The author organizes the article in chronological order.      He or she stated that in 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite. In paragraph 6, they stated that in February 2009, two satellites collided into each other. Finally, in 2008, they wrote about how a tool bag escaped from the International Space Station (ISS).",0,1
24243,The author tell us what happens in space and how space agenices work to keep satellites from crashing to each other.,0,1
24248,First theres an introduction and that gets you to want to read and figure out what the purpose of the story is. Then it explains what space junk is and gives history of how it has been made and some history about satellites. After that it gives and example of a time in which an occurance has happened when two satellites collided. Then the story goes on about what precautions and how dangerous it is when they launch space missions or satellites. I thought it was a good way to organize it all.,2,1
24258,"The author organizes the article by providing an example of space junk, why it is occuring, and just how dangerous space junk can be. In the first section, the writer tells about the tool bag, and how orbitals for stalites are cluttered. In the second and third sections, the writer is explaining what space junk is, and how it occurs.

This organization is effective, because the reader wants to continue reading for explanations and examples.",2,1
24277,The author gets us thinking about space and the things that go on. Then gives us the history about the space exploration and the dangers there are in space. The author tells us about all the space junk especially that can be seriously dangerous. All the information lead up to the fact that there is a lot of junk floating around in space thats dangerous and that the satellites could collide because it has happened before.,0,1

Then it goes to the next section going into detail in the 'Crash Course' artice where it talkes about how space junk is always colliding and in a crash course. Finially it talks about how the smaller pieces of junk could be the works parts of the Junk in the Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section.",1,2
24297,He puts it into sections. First he tells what space junk is. Next he tells how it is created. Last he tells how cares about this and tells that NASA is looking for a solution for space junk.,2,1
24299,I think the author organizes the article very well. The author organized it so you know when you are changing subjects and so you will know the different things the author is talking about.

24333,"In this article, the author has organized it in a unique way. The author has used the providing information to contrast the harmful dangers of space junk. The article is seperated in different categories where that topic is explained. The author tries to emphasize the importance of the outcome we will have if people ignore this situation. With no one to control the dead satellites, they run with great risks of 'colliding with each other.' This can cause a harmful effect and is what happened in February 2009. This impact caused hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path.",2,1
24336,The author organizes the problem by starting at the beggining when we first started exploring space.

Lastly, they address what they have tried to do to reduce the amount of space junk that is orbitting our planet.",2,1
24348,They organize it by the data. In 'What Is Spave Junk' they stick to just describing certain things and then when they wanted to go to a new subject they went into 'Crash Course.' They kept all of the same ideas together instead of running them all together.,0,2
24349,"The author organizes this article in sequential order.  The article starts by telling you what 'space junk' is.  Then, the author tells you what affects it has on satellites.

Then the author asks the question, 'What is space junk?' and follows it with a historical answer. The author goes into detail about the amount of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satelites, that have been launched into space over the last 52 years.     With all of this stuff in orbit around the earth, many things can crash and become space debris. This poses a threat to future space missions because bits of junk flying at intense speeds can cause harm to a spacecraft or an astronaut.

The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster.

Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.

The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.'
