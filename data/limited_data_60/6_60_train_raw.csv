14208,One prcess is the use of the semi-permeable membrane which regulates what goes in and out of the cell. Another one is osmosis which regulates what water moleucles can go in and out of the cell. in plants their cell wall controls what can get into the cell membrane by acting as a barrier from outside organisms.,2,2
14535,"Osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane. Osmosis is the diffusion of water. Diffusion is when molecules move from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane. Another way is by facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is when the molecules move from a low concentration to a high concentration, against the concentration gradient. This type of diffusion requires ATP. A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis. Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell. This process occurs by diffusion.",2,2
15607,One movement process is called osmosis.  This process is when water is transported across the cell membrane.  Another process is called facilitated diffusion.  That is when the channel proteins control what go in and out of a cell. The third process is called diffusion.  This is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane.,2,2
14673,"One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport. Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy. Diffusion is another way of transporting substances.",2,2

15480,"Facilitated diffusion- is a way that substances move from one form of concentration to another form of consintration, diffusion- it takes substances from an area of high concentration to low consintraion, osmosis- deals with the water bieng moved",3,3
15030,"Diffusion:  movement of materials from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.Osmosis:  moving of water across the cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration.Sodium-Potassium pump:  movement of potassium ions across the cell membrane, being replaced by sodium ions.  (Results in the feeling of something (pain, heat, cold.))",3,3
15049,"The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.",3,3
15421,diffusion-is the movement of somthing froma higher concentration to a lower concentration.osmosis-is the movement of water from higher concentrations to lower concentrations through a membranesodium pottasium pump- the use of energy to transfer sodium and pottasium ions from lower concentrations to higher concentrations.,3,3
15339,Osmosis - Diffusion of water through the cell membrane.Active Transport - Cell uses activation energy to surround and engulf the object.Passive Transport - Cell uses no energy and lets the object pass through the cell membrane with a special protein.,3,3
15713,"Cells can use osmosis which is the diffusion of water across a cell membrane.Cells can use facilitated diffusion which is the movement of particales across a membrane.Cells can use passive or active transport. Active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein, this uses energy.  Passive transport does not use channel proteins, nor does it use energy.",3,3
14261,The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.,3,3
14485,"One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.",3,3
14367,"The three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis, active transport and passive transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semi-permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy. Active transport is when molecules are getting diffused against the concentration gradient and passive transport is when molecules are diffused going with the concentration garadient",3,3
14236,"Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration. Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.",3,3
14285,"Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. Diffusion is the process of substances moving across a membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration, or with the concentration gradient. Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles. Active transportation is the process of substance moving through a membrane against the concentration gradient, or from low to high concentration.",3,3
15101,Osmosis is the process where water flows in and out of the cell membrane.Active transport uses energy to move molecules throught he membrane of a cell.Passive transport is a process where molecules move through the cell membrane without the use of energy.,3,3
