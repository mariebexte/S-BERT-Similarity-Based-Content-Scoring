14100,they help them movethe are a celll in a membraneand they control the movement of substances.,0,0
14478,1.Cell Membrane-the outer oart of the organism.2.Cell wall-protects the organism and anthitng entering and leaving.3.Nucleus-helps the organisms function.,0,0
15210,"They use the flagellum to move, therefore it could help move things across the membrane. Also the muscles, like with blood flow, and finally the heart because it pumps blood and oxygen all over the body.",0,0
14283,Osmosis is one kind of movement. Osmosis is the movement of particle across a cel membrane.Diffusion is another kind of movement across a cell membrane. it moves particles across it by breaking teh particle down.Active transport is another way. Active transport uses energy to get the particles across it safely with out harming the cell.,1,1
15461,"Active Transport allows substances to move across the cell membrance from low to high concentration. Active Transport uses energy.Osomis allows substances to move across the cell membrance without using energy. Therefore, moving from a high to low concentration.Diffusion allows substances to move across the cell membrane by diffusing them across the cell.",1,1
15105,"Cells control the movement of substamces across the cell membrane by not allowing any harmful substances through the membrane, being simi-permiabel by controling what can and can't go through the membrane, and going throug exocytosis to get rid of any harmful waste inside the cell.",1,1
14334,"One way is the tRNA moves proteins to the cytoplasm.Another way is through Active Transport, Active Transport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy.",2,2
15312,Active Transport-Transport that uses energy in transporting objests across the membrane.Diffusion-Diffusion of objects across a permeable membrane.Osmosis-Movment of water across a membrane.,2,2
14885,"Their is active transport, passive transport, and then their is gradient transport. Active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell. Passive transport is where subtances pass through the memebrane with out the cell using energy to bring subtances.",2,2
15728,Passive Transport-where no energy is needed for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Active Transport-where energy is required for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Endocytosis-the process where the cell surrounds sumthing and brings it into the cell because it is to big to travel through one of the channels.,3,3
14816,Osmosis. The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane.Active Transport. The movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradient.Passive Transport. The movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient.,3,3
15306,"Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and a semi-permable membrane.  Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.",3,3
