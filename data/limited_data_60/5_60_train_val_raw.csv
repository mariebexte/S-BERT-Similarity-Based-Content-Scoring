10992,"When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome.

12258,"The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm.  There, it attaches to a ribosome.  Attatched to the ribosome, rRNA comes and brings different codons for amino acids from the mRNA strand to the tRNA strand.  The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand.  The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand.  As this occurs, ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein.  When the rRNA brings a stop codon, the process ends and the strand containing the protein brakes off to form the actual amino acid for the cell.",2,2
12399,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome. The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon. Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid.

12467,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, after going through the process of trancription where the RNA polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves, the mRNA goes to the ribosome. Translation occurs when tRNA makes a copy of the DNA segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mRNA strand. The complementary base pairs start to link onto the mRNA strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented. Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand.",3,3
11846,"First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome.

11872,"1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.",3,3
11723,"The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.  Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.  Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.",3,3
11733,"First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it. Second, the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence, or codon, and calls for a tRNA molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon. Third, after this process is repeated, the amino acids on the tRNA molecules form peptide bonds with each other, forming a protein. Finally, after the mRNA is translated until a stop codon, the protein is released and used in the cell as needed.",3,3
12500,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome. The ribosome attaches and reads until it sees the codon AUG.

11780,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it meets up with a RNA polymerase which begins to read the sequence at a start codon. As it reads the mRNA codons and tRNA begin bringing amino acids as they are called for by the mRNA. These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA. Once it reaches the stop codon, it stops and the new protein made of all te amino acids is taken away.",3,3
10981,"Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon.
